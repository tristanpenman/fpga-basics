# FPGA Projects

This repo contains a collection of FPGA projects targeting [Papilio Pro](https://papilio.cc/index.php?n=Papilio.PapilioPro) boards, which are based on the [Spartan 6 LX9 FPGA](http://www.xilinx.com/support/documentation/data_sheets/ds160.pdf). The code was written in VHDL using [Xilinx ISE Design Suite 14.7](https://www.xilinx.com/products/design-tools/ise-design-suite/ise-webpack.html) (WebPACK Edition).
